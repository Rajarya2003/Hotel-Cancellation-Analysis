# Hotel Cancellation Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze hotel booking cancellations for City Hotels and Resort Hotels. The objective is to identify factors influencing cancellations and provide actionable recommendations to optimize hotel revenue and booking efficiency.

## 📊 Business Problem
Hotels face high cancellation rates, leading to revenue loss and inefficient room utilization. This analysis explores cancellation patterns and suggests strategies to mitigate losses.

## 🔍 Research Questions
1. What factors influence hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How can hotels reduce cancellations and improve booking retention?
3. How can pricing and promotional strategies be optimized?

## 🎯 Hypotheses
- Higher prices lead to increased cancellations.
- Longer waiting lists contribute to higher cancellation rates.
- Most bookings come from offline travel agents.

## 📈 Key Findings
- **37% of total bookings** resulted in cancellations, significantly impacting revenue.
- **City hotels have more bookings** than resort hotels, possibly due to pricing differences.
- **Peak cancellations occur in January**, while August has the highest confirmed reservations.
- **Portugal has the highest cancellation rate** among all countries.
- **46% of bookings come from online travel agencies**, while only 4% are direct bookings.

## 💡 Recommendations
1. **Optimize pricing strategies** to lower cancellation rates by offering competitive prices and discounts.
2. **Targeted promotions in January** to counteract the high cancellation rate.
3. **Improve service quality in high-cancellation regions**, especially Portugal.
4. **Offer weekend/holiday discounts** to balance resort and city hotel booking patterns.
